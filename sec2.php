    <h2>Welcome to bitlink</h2>
        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>Bitlink Company Ltd. was started with a simple principle in mind: that ICT should be an enabler, not a bottleneck. Few companies in Kenya and East Africa ever achieve even 50% of the possible operational benefits from their ICT systems.</P>
        
        <p>With that in mind, Bitlink was founded in 1998 with a new business model:
        <br><br>    
        <strong>It was technical staff, and not the sales team…</strong></p>

    </div>
    <div class="s2">
    <br><br>
        <P><strong> that would call the shots.</strong> Giving the customer exactly what they were promised, and exactly what they needed, was the top priority.
        
        <p>Two years later, we opened our office at the Upper Hill business hub in Nairobi. Since then, we have expanded our service offerings while staying true to our mission.</p>
        
        <p>We help organisations realise the benefits of ICT and Power solutions that just work—no hassle, no hidden costs, and no compromise.</p>
